# MOVIES-ETL
## Overview
### Amazing Prime loves the dataset and wants to keep it updated on a daily basis. Britta needs your help to create an automated pipeline that takes in new data, performs the appropriate transformations, and loads the data into existing tables. You’ll need to refactor the code from this module to create one function that takes in the three files—Wikipedia data, Kaggle metadata, and the MovieLens rating data—and performs the ETL process by adding the data to a PostgreSQL database. 
## Summary and Outcome
### By doing that I wrote an ETL Function to read three data files. I then Extracted and transformed the Wikipedia Data and Kaggle Data. Finally I merged the data frames to create a Movies Database and uploaded it to SQL dataframes.

### Here are some photos of my final DataFrames.
